# Eight-Tile
Eight-Tile, completed in November 2016, was the second assignment of my Programing in C course. The assignment involved writing a program that would solve the Chinese Eight-Tile problem and display the solution in the terminal. The Chinese Eight-Tile problem is a three by three board with eight numbered tiles (i.e., one to eight) in it. The problem involves moving the numbered tiles until they are in sequential order.

## Assignment
The basic assignment was to write a program that could determine whether an Eight-Tile board was solvable and if it was, display the sequence of steps required in the terminal.

#### Extension
The extension was to increase the speed at which the program could solve an Eight-Tile problem.
